# Architectural Decisions

## [2026-01] DashScope over Anthropic for VDS AI calls

**Context:** Site needs AI capabilities (vision, text generation) running on the VDS.
**Decision:** Use Alibaba DashScope (Qwen models) instead of Anthropic Claude for all VDS-side AI.
**Rationale:** Anthropic API returns 403 from Russian IPs. DashScope Singapore region has no IP restrictions.
**Alternatives:** Proxy through US server (latency, cost), OpenAI (also geo-restricted).

## [2026-01] JSON file storage instead of database

**Context:** Site needs to persist catalog data, user records, news articles.
**Decision:** Use JSON files on disk (`/var/www/jckauto/storage/`).
**Rationale:** Current scale (~50 cars, ~500 bot users) doesn't justify database overhead. JSON is human-readable, easy to debug, zero config.
**Alternatives:** SQLite (overkill for now), PostgreSQL (unnecessary complexity).

## [2026-02] calculator.ts as single engine for both site and bot

**Context:** Calculator logic was duplicated — site had its own implementation, bot had another.
**Decision:** Unified `calculateTotal()` function in `src/lib/calculator.ts` consumed by both.
**Rationale:** Single source of truth prevents rate/formula drift. Both consumers get identical results.

## [2026-03] Rename tariffs.ts and currencyRates.ts

**Context:** Files were named `calculator-data.ts` and `currency.ts` — unclear purpose.
**Decision:** Renamed to `tariffs.ts` and `currencyRates.ts`.
**Rationale:** Names now describe content, not usage context.

## [2026-03] GitHub Actions runner for Anthropic API calls

**Context:** Claude Vision API needed for catalog screenshot parsing. Can't call from VDS (403).
**Decision:** Run AI processing scripts on GitHub Actions runner (US IP), SCP files to/from VDS.
**Rationale:** Free GitHub runner minutes, US IP bypasses geo-block. 5-step sync chain handles data transfer.

## [2026-04] VTB sell rate from sravni.ru as primary exchange rate source

**Context:** CBR rates understate real cost by 3-7%. Customers see unrealistically low prices.
**Decision:** Scrape VTB sell rate from sravni.ru as primary source. Fall back to CBR × configurable markup per currency.
**Rationale:** VTB sell rate reflects actual bank pricing. Per-currency fallback ensures no single point of failure.
**Alternatives:** Hardcoded markup only (less accurate), multiple bank scraping (over-engineering).

## [2026-04] /api/exchange-rates endpoint for client components

**Context:** Client components importing fetchCBRRates() directly caused sravni.ru CORS errors in browser.
**Decision:** Created `/api/exchange-rates` server route. Client components fetch from there.
**Rationale:** Server-side fetch has no CORS. Cache-Control headers (5min) reduce load. Bot still calls fetchCBRRates() directly (server-side, no CORS).

## [2026-04] CalculatorCore as shared component

**Context:** Homepage calculator section and /tools/calculator page had duplicated calculator code.
**Decision:** Extract `CalculatorCore.tsx` as shared body. Both pages are thin wrappers.
**Rationale:** Single source of truth for form state, rate loading, and result rendering. Eliminates homepage CORS bug (old section imported fetchCBRRates directly).

## [2026-04] PDFKit with Roboto TTF for Cyrillic

**Context:** PDFKit default Helvetica has no Cyrillic glyphs — all Russian text rendered as garbage.
**Decision:** Bundle Roboto-Regular.ttf and Roboto-Bold.ttf in `public/fonts/`, register as Body/BodyBold.
**Rationale:** Roboto has full Cyrillic coverage, is free (Google Fonts), and adds only ~1MB to repo.
**Alternatives:** System fonts (unreliable in Docker/server), custom font subset (complex build).

## [2026-04] GitHub Actions auto-merge for claude/** branches

**Context:** All development happens on `claude/**` branches. Merging into `main` was manual and often forgotten.
**Decision:** Add `.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml` that triggers on push to `claude/**` branches and merges into `main` with `--no-ff`.
**Rationale:** Zero manual merge steps. Every push to a claude branch automatically lands in main. Uses GITHUB_TOKEN (no extra secrets). Workflow fails gracefully on merge conflicts — developer resolves manually.
**Alternatives:** Branch protection with auto-merge PRs (more ceremony), manual merges (status quo, error-prone).

## [2026-04] Auto-deploy via workflow_run after auto-merge

**Context:** After auto-merge lands code in `main`, deployment to VDS was still manual (SSH + pull + build + restart).
**Decision:** Add `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` triggered by `workflow_run` (after auto-merge completes) and direct push to `main`. SSHs into VDS via `appleboy/ssh-action`, pulls, builds, restarts both PM2 processes.
**Rationale:** `workflow_run` is required because GITHUB_TOKEN pushes don't trigger `on: push` workflows. Bot uses `pm2 delete` + `pm2 start` (never `pm2 restart`) because `pm2 restart` does not reload `.env.local`. Build requires `NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=1536"` due to server memory constraints.
**Alternatives:** Manual deploy.sh (status quo, error-prone), webhook-triggered deploy (requires inbound port).

## [2026-04-10] Image compression before DashScope vision API

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
`/api/tools/auction-sheet` accepts user-uploaded auction sheet photos (up to 10MB).
Large or high-resolution images sent directly to DashScope `qwen3.5-plus` vision model
caused processing time to exceed 60 seconds — nginx default `proxy_read_timeout`.
Result: users received *«Ошибка сети. Проверьте подключение.»* on every request.
Increasing nginx timeout to 120s was rejected: users will not wait 2 minutes for a result.

**Decision:**
Compress images server-side using Sharp before sending to DashScope.
Parameters chosen to balance speed vs. text legibility on auction sheets:

- Resize: max `2000×2000px`, `fit: 'inside'`, `withoutEnlargement: true`
- Format: JPEG, `quality: 85`
- Sharpen: `sigma 0.5` (restores fine text sharpness lost during downscale)
- Output: always `image/jpeg` regardless of input format (PNG, WebP, HEIC)

HEIC support: confirmed via `libheif` in installed Sharp version.

**Consequences:**

- `+` Processing time reduced from 60+ seconds to approximately 10–20 seconds
- `+` All input formats (JPG, PNG, WebP, HEIC) normalized to JPEG before API call
- `+` Small images (already under 2000px) only undergo format conversion, not resize
- `+` Sharp was already in `devDependencies` — no new dependency added
- `−` Slight quality loss on very high-res source images (acceptable for OCR use case)

**Files changed:**
- `jck-auto/src/app/api/tools/auction-sheet/route.ts`

## [2026-04-10] Telegram webhook via Cloudflare Worker (bidirectional proxy)

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
VDS provider (Selectel / similar) blocks both directions of Telegram traffic:

1. **Outgoing:** VDS → `api.telegram.org` (bot cannot send messages directly)
2. **Incoming:** Telegram IP ranges → VDS (webhook delivery times out intermittently)

Outgoing was already solved via Cloudflare Worker (`TELEGRAM_API_BASE_URL` env var).
Incoming was initially registered directly on `jckauto.ru` — causing 2–5 minute delays
in bot responses as Telegram retried timed-out webhook deliveries.

The existing `tg-proxy` Worker already contained incoming webhook routing code:

```js
if (url.pathname.startsWith("/webhook/")) {
  const vdsUrl = "https://jckauto.ru/bot-webhook/" + url.pathname.slice("/webhook/".length);
  return fetch(vdsUrl, { method, headers, body });
}
```

This code was present but unused — webhook was registered on `jckauto.ru` directly.

**Decision:**
Register Telegram webhook on Worker URL instead of directly on VDS:

- WRONG: `https://jckauto.ru/bot-webhook/bot{TOKEN}`
- CORRECT: `https://tg-proxy.t9242540001.workers.dev/webhook/bot{TOKEN}`

Worker receives POST from Telegram (Cloudflare is always reachable),
then forwards to `https://jckauto.ru/bot-webhook/bot{TOKEN}` as an internal request.
Provider restrictions do not apply to Cloudflare → VDS traffic.

Registration command:

```bash
TOKEN=$(grep TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN /var/www/jckauto/app/jck-auto/.env.local | cut -d= -f2)
curl -s "https://tg-proxy.t9242540001.workers.dev/bot${TOKEN}/setWebhook?url=https://tg-proxy.t9242540001.workers.dev/webhook/bot${TOKEN}" | jq .
```

**Consequences:**

- `+` Bot response latency reduced from 2–5 minutes (retry delays) to `<1 second`
- `+` No code changes required — Worker routing was already implemented
- `+` Telegram → Worker connection uses Cloudflare infrastructure (reliable, no blocking)
- `−` `setWebhook` must be re-run manually after: token change, Worker URL change
- `−` Worker code is not in git — lives only in Cloudflare Dashboard (single point of truth risk)

**Files changed:**
- None — configuration change only (`setWebhook` API call).
