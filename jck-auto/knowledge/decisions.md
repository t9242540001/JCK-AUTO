# Architectural Decisions

## [2026-01] DashScope over Anthropic for VDS AI calls

**Context:** Site needs AI capabilities (vision, text generation) running on the VDS.
**Decision:** Use Alibaba DashScope (Qwen models) instead of Anthropic Claude for all VDS-side AI.
**Rationale:** Anthropic API returns 403 from Russian IPs. DashScope Singapore region has no IP restrictions.
**Alternatives:** Proxy through US server (latency, cost), OpenAI (also geo-restricted).

## [2026-01] JSON file storage instead of database

**Context:** Site needs to persist catalog data, user records, news articles.
**Decision:** Use JSON files on disk (`/var/www/jckauto/storage/`).
**Rationale:** Current scale (~50 cars, ~500 bot users) doesn't justify database overhead. JSON is human-readable, easy to debug, zero config.
**Alternatives:** SQLite (overkill for now), PostgreSQL (unnecessary complexity).

## [2026-02] calculator.ts as single engine for both site and bot

**Context:** Calculator logic was duplicated — site had its own implementation, bot had another.
**Decision:** Unified `calculateTotal()` function in `src/lib/calculator.ts` consumed by both.
**Rationale:** Single source of truth prevents rate/formula drift. Both consumers get identical results.

## [2026-03] Rename tariffs.ts and currencyRates.ts

**Context:** Files were named `calculator-data.ts` and `currency.ts` — unclear purpose.
**Decision:** Renamed to `tariffs.ts` and `currencyRates.ts`.
**Rationale:** Names now describe content, not usage context.

## [2026-03] GitHub Actions runner for Anthropic API calls

**Context:** Claude Vision API needed for catalog screenshot parsing. Can't call from VDS (403).
**Decision:** Run AI processing scripts on GitHub Actions runner (US IP), SCP files to/from VDS.
**Rationale:** Free GitHub runner minutes, US IP bypasses geo-block. 5-step sync chain handles data transfer.

## [2026-04] VTB sell rate from sravni.ru as primary exchange rate source

**Context:** CBR rates understate real cost by 3-7%. Customers see unrealistically low prices.
**Decision:** Scrape VTB sell rate from sravni.ru as primary source. Fall back to CBR × configurable markup per currency.
**Rationale:** VTB sell rate reflects actual bank pricing. Per-currency fallback ensures no single point of failure.
**Alternatives:** Hardcoded markup only (less accurate), multiple bank scraping (over-engineering).

## [2026-04] /api/exchange-rates endpoint for client components

**Context:** Client components importing fetchCBRRates() directly caused sravni.ru CORS errors in browser.
**Decision:** Created `/api/exchange-rates` server route. Client components fetch from there.
**Rationale:** Server-side fetch has no CORS. Cache-Control headers (5min) reduce load. Bot still calls fetchCBRRates() directly (server-side, no CORS).

## [2026-04] CalculatorCore as shared component

**Context:** Homepage calculator section and /tools/calculator page had duplicated calculator code.
**Decision:** Extract `CalculatorCore.tsx` as shared body. Both pages are thin wrappers.
**Rationale:** Single source of truth for form state, rate loading, and result rendering. Eliminates homepage CORS bug (old section imported fetchCBRRates directly).

## [2026-04] PDFKit with Roboto TTF for Cyrillic

**Context:** PDFKit default Helvetica has no Cyrillic glyphs — all Russian text rendered as garbage.
**Decision:** Bundle Roboto-Regular.ttf and Roboto-Bold.ttf in `public/fonts/`, register as Body/BodyBold.
**Rationale:** Roboto has full Cyrillic coverage, is free (Google Fonts), and adds only ~1MB to repo.
**Alternatives:** System fonts (unreliable in Docker/server), custom font subset (complex build).

## [2026-04] GitHub Actions auto-merge for claude/** branches

**Context:** All development happens on `claude/**` branches. Merging into `main` was manual and often forgotten.
**Decision:** Add `.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml` that triggers on push to `claude/**` branches and merges into `main` with `--no-ff`.
**Rationale:** Zero manual merge steps. Every push to a claude branch automatically lands in main. Uses GITHUB_TOKEN (no extra secrets). Workflow fails gracefully on merge conflicts — developer resolves manually.
**Alternatives:** Branch protection with auto-merge PRs (more ceremony), manual merges (status quo, error-prone).
