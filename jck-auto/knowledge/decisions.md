# Architectural Decisions

## [2026-01] DashScope over Anthropic for VDS AI calls

**Context:** Site needs AI capabilities (vision, text generation) running on the VDS.
**Decision:** Use Alibaba DashScope (Qwen models) instead of Anthropic Claude for all VDS-side AI.
**Rationale:** Anthropic API returns 403 from Russian IPs. DashScope Singapore region has no IP restrictions.
**Alternatives:** Proxy through US server (latency, cost), OpenAI (also geo-restricted).

## [2026-01] JSON file storage instead of database

**Context:** Site needs to persist catalog data, user records, news articles.
**Decision:** Use JSON files on disk (`/var/www/jckauto/storage/`).
**Rationale:** Current scale (~50 cars, ~500 bot users) doesn't justify database overhead. JSON is human-readable, easy to debug, zero config.
**Alternatives:** SQLite (overkill for now), PostgreSQL (unnecessary complexity).

## [2026-02] calculator.ts as single engine for both site and bot

**Context:** Calculator logic was duplicated — site had its own implementation, bot had another.
**Decision:** Unified `calculateTotal()` function in `src/lib/calculator.ts` consumed by both.
**Rationale:** Single source of truth prevents rate/formula drift. Both consumers get identical results.

## [2026-03] Rename tariffs.ts and currencyRates.ts

**Context:** Files were named `calculator-data.ts` and `currency.ts` — unclear purpose.
**Decision:** Renamed to `tariffs.ts` and `currencyRates.ts`.
**Rationale:** Names now describe content, not usage context.

## [2026-03] GitHub Actions runner for Anthropic API calls

**Context:** Claude Vision API needed for catalog screenshot parsing. Can't call from VDS (403).
**Decision:** Run AI processing scripts on GitHub Actions runner (US IP), SCP files to/from VDS.
**Rationale:** Free GitHub runner minutes, US IP bypasses geo-block. 5-step sync chain handles data transfer.

## [2026-04] VTB sell rate from sravni.ru as primary exchange rate source

**Context:** CBR rates understate real cost by 3-7%. Customers see unrealistically low prices.
**Decision:** Scrape VTB sell rate from sravni.ru as primary source. Fall back to CBR × configurable markup per currency.
**Rationale:** VTB sell rate reflects actual bank pricing. Per-currency fallback ensures no single point of failure.
**Alternatives:** Hardcoded markup only (less accurate), multiple bank scraping (over-engineering).

## [2026-04] /api/exchange-rates endpoint for client components

**Context:** Client components importing fetchCBRRates() directly caused sravni.ru CORS errors in browser.
**Decision:** Created `/api/exchange-rates` server route. Client components fetch from there.
**Rationale:** Server-side fetch has no CORS. Cache-Control headers (5min) reduce load. Bot still calls fetchCBRRates() directly (server-side, no CORS).

## [2026-04] CalculatorCore as shared component

**Context:** Homepage calculator section and /tools/calculator page had duplicated calculator code.
**Decision:** Extract `CalculatorCore.tsx` as shared body. Both pages are thin wrappers.
**Rationale:** Single source of truth for form state, rate loading, and result rendering. Eliminates homepage CORS bug (old section imported fetchCBRRates directly).

## [2026-04] PDFKit with Roboto TTF for Cyrillic

**Context:** PDFKit default Helvetica has no Cyrillic glyphs — all Russian text rendered as garbage.
**Decision:** Bundle Roboto-Regular.ttf and Roboto-Bold.ttf in `public/fonts/`, register as Body/BodyBold.
**Rationale:** Roboto has full Cyrillic coverage, is free (Google Fonts), and adds only ~1MB to repo.
**Alternatives:** System fonts (unreliable in Docker/server), custom font subset (complex build).

## [2026-04] GitHub Actions auto-merge for claude/** branches

**Status:** SUPERSEDED on 2026-04-15 — see [2026-04-15] PAT_AUTO_MERGE for auto-merge to trigger downstream workflows.

**Context:** All development happens on `claude/**` branches. Merging into `main` was manual and often forgotten.
**Decision:** Add `.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml` that triggers on push to `claude/**` branches and merges into `main` with `--no-ff`.
**Rationale:** Zero manual merge steps. Every push to a claude branch automatically lands in main. Uses GITHUB_TOKEN (no extra secrets). Workflow fails gracefully on merge conflicts — developer resolves manually.
**Alternatives:** Branch protection with auto-merge PRs (more ceremony), manual merges (status quo, error-prone).

## [2026-04] Auto-deploy via workflow_run after auto-merge

**Status:** SUPERSEDED on 2026-04-15 — see [2026-04-15] Push trigger only for deploy.yml.

**Context:** After auto-merge lands code in `main`, deployment to VDS was still manual (SSH + pull + build + restart).
**Decision:** Add `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` triggered by `workflow_run` (after auto-merge completes) and direct push to `main`. SSHs into VDS via `appleboy/ssh-action`, pulls, builds, restarts both PM2 processes.
**Rationale:** `workflow_run` is required because GITHUB_TOKEN pushes don't trigger `on: push` workflows. Bot uses `pm2 delete` + `pm2 start` (never `pm2 restart`) because `pm2 restart` does not reload `.env.local`. Build requires `NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=1536"` due to server memory constraints.
**Alternatives:** Manual deploy.sh (status quo, error-prone), webhook-triggered deploy (requires inbound port).

## [2026-04-10] Image compression before DashScope vision API

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
`/api/tools/auction-sheet` accepts user-uploaded auction sheet photos (up to 10MB).
Large or high-resolution images sent directly to DashScope `qwen3.5-plus` vision model
caused processing time to exceed 60 seconds — nginx default `proxy_read_timeout`.
Result: users received *«Ошибка сети. Проверьте подключение.»* on every request.
Increasing nginx timeout to 120s was rejected: users will not wait 2 minutes for a result.

**Decision:**
Compress images server-side using Sharp before sending to DashScope.
Parameters chosen to balance speed vs. text legibility on auction sheets:

- Resize: max `2000×2000px`, `fit: 'inside'`, `withoutEnlargement: true`
- Format: JPEG, `quality: 85`
- Sharpen: `sigma 0.5` (restores fine text sharpness lost during downscale)
- Output: always `image/jpeg` regardless of input format (PNG, WebP, HEIC)

HEIC support: confirmed via `libheif` in installed Sharp version.

**Consequences:**

- `+` Processing time reduced from 60+ seconds to approximately 10–20 seconds
- `+` All input formats (JPG, PNG, WebP, HEIC) normalized to JPEG before API call
- `+` Small images (already under 2000px) only undergo format conversion, not resize
- `+` Sharp was already in `devDependencies` — no new dependency added
- `−` Slight quality loss on very high-res source images (acceptable for OCR use case)

**Files changed:**
- `jck-auto/src/app/api/tools/auction-sheet/route.ts`

## [2026-04-10] Telegram webhook via Cloudflare Worker (bidirectional proxy)

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
VDS provider (Selectel / similar) blocks both directions of Telegram traffic:

1. **Outgoing:** VDS → `api.telegram.org` (bot cannot send messages directly)
2. **Incoming:** Telegram IP ranges → VDS (webhook delivery times out intermittently)

Outgoing was already solved via Cloudflare Worker (`TELEGRAM_API_BASE_URL` env var).
Incoming was initially registered directly on `jckauto.ru` — causing 2–5 minute delays
in bot responses as Telegram retried timed-out webhook deliveries.

The existing `tg-proxy` Worker already contained incoming webhook routing code:

```js
if (url.pathname.startsWith("/webhook/")) {
  const vdsUrl = "https://jckauto.ru/bot-webhook/" + url.pathname.slice("/webhook/".length);
  return fetch(vdsUrl, { method, headers, body });
}
```

This code was present but unused — webhook was registered on `jckauto.ru` directly.

**Decision:**
Register Telegram webhook on Worker URL instead of directly on VDS:

- WRONG: `https://jckauto.ru/bot-webhook/bot{TOKEN}`
- CORRECT: `https://tg-proxy.t9242540001.workers.dev/webhook/bot{TOKEN}`

Worker receives POST from Telegram (Cloudflare is always reachable),
then forwards to `https://jckauto.ru/bot-webhook/bot{TOKEN}` as an internal request.
Provider restrictions do not apply to Cloudflare → VDS traffic.

Registration command:

```bash
TOKEN=$(grep TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN /var/www/jckauto/app/jck-auto/.env.local | cut -d= -f2)
curl -s "https://tg-proxy.t9242540001.workers.dev/bot${TOKEN}/setWebhook?url=https://tg-proxy.t9242540001.workers.dev/webhook/bot${TOKEN}" | jq .
```

**Consequences:**

- `+` Bot response latency reduced from 2–5 minutes (retry delays) to `<1 second`
- `+` No code changes required — Worker routing was already implemented
- `+` Telegram → Worker connection uses Cloudflare infrastructure (reliable, no blocking)
- `−` `setWebhook` must be re-run manually after: token change, Worker URL change
- `−` Worker code is not in git — lives only in Cloudflare Dashboard (single point of truth risk)

**Files changed:**
- None — configuration change only (`setWebhook` API call).

## [2026-04-15] PAT_AUTO_MERGE for auto-merge to trigger downstream workflows

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
GitHub built-in protection: pushes authenticated by `GITHUB_TOKEN` do
NOT fire `on: push` workflows in the same repository. Auto-merge of
`claude/**` branches into `main` was authenticating with `GITHUB_TOKEN`,
so the merge commit pushed to `main` never triggered `deploy.yml`'s
`on: push` listener. The original ADR `[2026-04] Auto-deploy via
workflow_run after auto-merge` worked around this with a `workflow_run`
trigger — which itself caused a separate problem
(see `[2026-04-15] Push trigger only for deploy.yml`).

**Decision:**
Create a fine-grained Personal Access Token (Contents: read+write,
Workflows: read+write, Metadata: read), scoped only to this repository,
store it as repository secret `PAT_AUTO_MERGE`, and use it in
`actions/checkout@v4` `token:` parameter inside auto-merge.yml. Pushes
authenticated with this PAT count as user pushes and DO fire downstream
workflows.

**Rationale:**
- Native solution to GitHub's built-in protection — no exotic workarounds.
- Minimal blast radius: PAT is scoped to one repo with narrow
  permissions.
- Works with the standard `on: push` trigger model — predictable.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Reusable workflow via `workflow_call`: requires deploy to run
  synchronously inside auto-merge, ties up runner slot, complicates
  permission model.
- Manual deploy after merge: defeats the purpose of auto-merge.

**Consequences:**
- `+` Deploy fires reliably on every auto-merge via the standard
  `push: branches: [main]` trigger.
- `+` Deploy uses the workflow file from the just-pushed commit, not
  a stale main-tip version.
- `−` PAT expires (1 year by default) — needs calendar reminder for
  rotation. Failure mode if expired: auto-merge returns 401, deploy
  silently does not fire.
- `−` Adds a manual secret to the repo (vs. zero-secret GITHUB_TOKEN
  approach).

**Files changed:**
- `.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml` (token reference).

## [2026-04-15] Push trigger only for deploy.yml (workflow_run removed)

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
`deploy.yml` originally had two triggers: `workflow_run` (after
auto-merge completes) and `push: branches: [main]`. After PAT_AUTO_MERGE
activation (see preceding ADR), `push:` fires reliably on every merge.
The `workflow_run` trigger then became actively harmful for two
reasons:

1. **Stale workflow-file execution.** GitHub resolves `workflow_run`
   triggers using the workflow file as it exists in main at the moment
   the originating workflow STARTS, NOT the file pushed by the merge
   commit. For a workflow that frequently edits itself (deploy.yml),
   this means each iteration ran the previous version of the deploy
   script. We lost ~24h of attempted improvements that were committed
   to main but never executed at runtime.
2. **Duplicate deploys.** Each auto-merge produced two Deploy runs —
   one from `push:` (using the new file) and one from `workflow_run:`
   (using the stale file). The stale one always ran second due to
   `concurrency: deploy-${repo}` serialization, overwriting the
   correct build's `.next` symlink with a directory.

**Decision:**
Remove the entire `workflow_run:` block from `on:` in deploy.yml. Keep
only `push: branches: [main]`. Direct hotfix pushes to main also
continue to work via the same trigger.

**Rationale:**
- Eliminates stale-execution class of bugs entirely.
- Eliminates duplicate deploys — one merge → one run.
- Manual hotfixes (rare) still work through the same trigger path.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Keep workflow_run with `if:` condition gating on workflow file SHA:
  fragile, hard to reason about.
- Move build into `auto-merge.yml` directly: violates separation of
  concerns (merge ≠ deploy).

**Consequences:**
- `+` Single deploy per merge.
- `+` Always uses the just-pushed workflow file.
- `−` GitHub still holds an old `workflow_run` subscription for stale
  reference if the auto-merge workflow name remains the same. Fully
  removing this requires renaming the auto-merge workflow (planned
  follow-up). Until then, residual stale-trigger duplicates may
  intermittently appear and must be ignored.

**Files changed:**
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (trigger block, job-level `if:`).

**`@rule` enforced in deploy.yml:**
Comment block above `on:` forbids re-adding `workflow_run` without a
new ADR.

## [2026-04-15] Two-slot atomic build with self-healing

**Status:** Accepted (formalized 2026-04-15 — implementation existed since 2026-04-09)

**Context:**
Original deploy schema built directly into `.next/`. During the build's
final phase Next.js 16 Turbopack writes `page_client-reference-manifest.js`
files. Any GET request between "old manifest deleted" and "new manifest
written" returned `InvariantError: client reference manifest does not
exist` → 500/502 on all routes for ~100 seconds per deploy. Combined
with PM2 `bash -c npm start` wrapping, this caused crash loops with
~70s restart cycles after every deploy.

**Decision:**
Two-slot atomic build:
- `.next-a` and `.next-b` are real directories.
- `.next` is a symlink pointing to whichever slot is currently active.
- Build runs into the INACTIVE slot via `NEXT_DIST_DIR="$NEXT_SLOT"
  npm run build`. Server keeps reading the active slot.
- After build completes, `ln -sfn "$NEXT_SLOT" .next` atomically
  switches the symlink. `pm2 restart jckauto` picks up the new bundle.
- Downtime reduced from ~100s to ~5–10s (PM2 restart only).

Self-healing block: if the deploy script finds `.next` as a regular
directory (someone ran `npm run build` without `NEXT_DIST_DIR`), it
auto-restores the two-slot setup before proceeding. WARNING-marker logs
make the recovery visible.

**Rationale:**
- Atomic symlink swap is a `rename(2)` syscall — invisible to running
  Node processes.
- Self-healing prevents one bad actor (manual build, broken cron) from
  permanently breaking deploys.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Blue-green deployment with two PM2 processes on different ports +
  nginx switch: more moving parts, requires nginx reload on every
  deploy.
- Build offline, rsync to VDS: requires building elsewhere, complicates
  secrets handling for build-time env.

**Consequences:**
- `+` Zero meaningful downtime on every deploy.
- `+` Self-healing absorbs accidental damage to symlink state.
- `−` Two slots take ~2× disk space for `.next/`.
- `−` Anyone running `npm run build` outside deploy.yml without
  `NEXT_DIST_DIR` triggers a self-healing WARNING on next deploy. Rule
  enforced in `knowledge/deploy.md §8` and `infrastructure.md`.

**Files changed:**
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (full SSH script).
- `jck-auto/next.config.ts` (`distDir: process.env.NEXT_DIST_DIR || '.next'`).

## [2026-04-15] Article cron writes MDX only — no build/restart

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
`scripts/generate-article.ts` previously ended with:

    execSync('npm run build', { cwd: PROJECT_ROOT, ... });
    execSync('pm2 restart jckauto', ...);

These calls did NOT pass `NEXT_DIST_DIR`, so each invocation created
`.next/` as a regular directory, destroying the two-slot symlink.
Confirmed root cause of intermittent two-slot breakage observed in
production logs (e.g., 2026-04-15 05:31 UTC — separate BUILD_ID in
`.next` not matching `.next-a`/`.next-b`, no GitHub Actions deploy in
that window).

**Decision:**
Remove the entire build/restart block from `generate-article.ts`. The
script now only:
1. Generates the topic and article text.
2. Generates the cover image.
3. Publishes the MDX file to `content/blog/{slug}.mdx`.
4. Appends to the published log.

A new article appears on https://jckauto.ru/blog (SSG route) only after
the next deploy. To force immediate appearance, push any trivial commit
to main — auto-deploy rebuilds with proper `NEXT_DIST_DIR`.

**Rationale:**
- Single responsibility: content generation ≠ deployment.
- Eliminates the only known mechanism that bypasses two-slot protection.
- Cron runs every 3 days; immediate visibility was never the actual
  requirement.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Wrap the build inside a correct two-slot sequence in this script:
  duplicates deploy.yml logic in a fragile place.
- Migrate `/blog/[slug]` to `force-dynamic` (like `/catalog`,
  `/news`): correct long-term solution, planned in roadmap.md as a
  separate task.

**Consequences:**
- `+` Two-slot symlink no longer broken by cron-generated articles.
- `+` Article generation script is simpler, safer, and faster
  (no longer waits on full Next.js build).
- `−` New articles have a delivery latency equal to the next deploy
  cycle. Acceptable until force-dynamic migration.

**Files changed:**
- `jck-auto/scripts/generate-article.ts` (removed execSync block,
  removed `child_process` import, renumbered "Шаг N/4" → "Шаг N/3").

**`@rule` enforced in generate-article.ts:**
Comment stub explicitly forbids any process-spawning mechanism in this
script.

## [2026-04-15] Separate workflow for runner-side deploy log capture

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
Diagnosing deploy failures required the user to manually copy-paste
the Actions UI log into chat — slow, error-prone, blocks fast iteration.
Embedded log-capture steps inside `deploy.yml` failed for two reasons:
(1) `gh run view --log` cannot read its own in-progress run, returning
a 34-byte stub; (2) `appleboy/scp-action` runs as a separate Docker
container without access to the host's `/tmp/`, so the upload step
failed with `tar: empty archive`.

**Decision:**
Add a separate workflow `.github/workflows/capture-deploy-log.yml`
triggered by `workflow_run` on `Deploy to VDS` with
`types: [completed]`. The capture workflow runs AFTER the deploy is
fully finished, so `gh run view` returns the complete log. File paths
use `${{ runner.temp }}/deploy-log/`, which IS mounted into action
containers (verified empirically).

The capture workflow then `scp`'s the log to
`/var/www/jckauto/deploy-logs/` on VDS and updates a `deploy-latest.log`
symlink. Logs are accessible via the JCK AUTO Files MCP connector for
direct Claude reading without copy-paste.

**Rationale:**
- Clean separation: deploy executes, capture observes — neither blocks
  the other.
- `workflow_run` trigger is appropriate here (unlike in deploy.yml)
  because this workflow rarely changes after creation and only reads
  data; stale-execution risk is minimal.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Ship logs to GitHub Artifact: requires UI/API roundtrip on each
  diagnosis, no MCP access from VDS context.
- Stream SSH output to a file inside the SSH script: tested in earlier
  attempts, fails because `appleboy/ssh-action` `script_stop: true`
  intercepts redirection setup.

**Consequences:**
- `+` Every deploy log persists on VDS, readable via MCP.
- `+` Diagnosis cycle drops from minutes (copy-paste) to seconds
  (one MCP read).
- `−` Adds one more workflow run per deploy in Actions UI.
- `−` Stale `workflow_run` subscription class of bug applies in
  principle, but capture workflow is small and stable, so risk is
  accepted.

**Files changed:**
- `.github/workflows/capture-deploy-log.yml` (new file).

**Follow-up:**
- Three broken post-SSH steps remain in `deploy.yml`. They do not
  block deploys (just mark runs as failed status because exit codes
  are non-zero). Removal scheduled for a separate cosmetic prompt.
- `strip_components: 4` for scp source path is empirically tuned. If
  the first run lands the file in a wrong subdirectory on VDS, adjust
  ±1 in a follow-up.
